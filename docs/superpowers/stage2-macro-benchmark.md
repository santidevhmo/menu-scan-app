# Stage-2 Macro Enrichment Benchmark — Log

Single append-only log for this phase. Spec:
`specs/2026-08-07-stage2-macro-enrichment-benchmark-design.md`.
Plan: `plans/2026-08-07-stage2-macro-benchmark.md`.

**Three artifacts only** in this phase — `scripts/fixtures/macro-oracle.json` (Santiago's
numbers), `scripts/bench-macros.ts` (the runner), and this log. Deliberately smaller than the
OCR phase's six, which drifted.

Newest **Runs** entries go at the BOTTOM.

## Current Stage-2 behaviour (the thing every backlog item is measured against)

Recorded so backlog entries have a stated baseline to differ from. Traced 2026-08-07, edge
function v24.

- **One GPT-4o call per batch of 10 items**, all batches fired in parallel. `temperature: 0`,
  `seed: 17`, strict `json_schema`. A retry fires once if the model returns fewer items than
  sent; dropped items are backfilled with zeros at `confidence: "low"`.
- **One stage, not two.** There is no separate portion-estimation call. Ingredients and macros
  come out of the same request.
- **Emitted field order** (load-bearing — OpenAI strict mode generates fields in schema order,
  so this IS the chain of thought):

  ```
  name → description → price → category
    → ingredients[]  ({name, category} only — NO gram weight)
    → protein_g → carb_g → fat_g → estimated_calories
    → confidence → allergens
  ```

  Note calories already come **after** the three macros. What is missing is any per-ingredient
  or whole-dish gram commitment before the numbers.

## Backlog — not started

**Rule: nothing here starts without a failure list from a real run to justify it.** A predicted
gain is a hypothesis until measured (lesson 16); a confident wrong estimate sends the next
session chasing the wrong work.

### B1 — Per-ingredient grams, same call

Add a `grams` field to each `ingredients[]` entry so the model commits to portions out loud
before totalling. Today it records *what* is in the dish and never *how much*, so its portion
assumption is unrecoverable from its output — and portion error is the leading suspect for
macro error.

Matches OpenAI's own documented guidance (`META_PROMPT`: *"field order matters. any form of
'thinking' or 'explanation' should come before the conclusion"*). Raises the prior; does not
promote it above a hypothesis.

Cost: no extra calls, slightly more output tokens.

### B2 — Batch-size sweep

`ENRICH_BATCH_SIZE` is 10 and has never been varied. Test 5 / 15 / 20.

⚠ **Three items is a single call at every batch size**, so this is not observable on the
starting benchmark set. Needs a larger item set — size it when picked up.

### B3 — Printed-weight scope

Resolve whether a printed weight means the whole plated dish or one component. `ENRICH_PROMPT`
says "prefer printed weights over guesses" and is silent on scope. `Salmone toscano … 200g`
served with a baguette is the live case in the starting set. Only pursue if the baseline shows
it firing.

### B4 — A dedicated portion/volume estimation stage *(added 2026-08-07, Santiago)*

Split Stage 2 into two calls: **(1)** estimate grams — per ingredient and/or total dish weight —
then **(2)** compute macros from those grams. Today both happen in one request.

**Distinct from B1, and the distinction matters:** B1 keeps one call and adds fields; B4 adds a
second call. B4 gives the portion step its own full attention budget and makes the intermediate
auditable and separately gradeable, at roughly double the enrichment cost and latency. Run B1
first — if simply writing the grams down inside one call closes the gap, B4 is unnecessary
work.

**Provenance:** suggested by a reconstruction of Cal AI's pipeline, which shows portion/volume
estimation as its own stage between food recognition and nutrition enrichment. See the
provenance caveat at the bottom of this section.

### B5 — Chain-of-thought field-order sweep *(added 2026-08-07, Santiago)*

Field order is the chain of thought, so reordering the schema is a real, cheap experiment — no
extra calls, one schema edit per arm. Arms worth testing against the current order:

| Arm | Order after `ingredients[]` | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **A — current** | `protein_g → carb_g → fat_g → estimated_calories` | baseline |
| **B — grams first** | `total_grams → protein_g → carb_g → fat_g → estimated_calories` | commit to portion before any macro |
| **C — calories early** | `estimated_calories → protein_g → carb_g → fat_g` | anchor on the number humans estimate best, then decompose |
| **D — grams + calories first** | `total_grams → estimated_calories → protein_g → carb_g → fat_g` | the Cal AI-implied order |

Score every arm on the same oracle with the same draws. Note arms C and D risk the macros being
back-fitted to a calorie guess rather than derived from ingredients — which is exactly what the
benchmark would reveal.

**Related option surfaced by this ordering question, not requested — flagged, not scheduled:**
calories are a deterministic function of macros (Atwater factors: 4 kcal/g protein, 4 kcal/g
carb, 9 kcal/g fat). So `estimated_calories` could be **computed in code** rather than asked of
the model, guaranteeing internal consistency. Worth knowing the current model output is often
*not* self-consistent under those factors — **unverified, check it against the baseline's
archived responses for $0 before treating it as a finding.**

### Provenance caveat for B4 and B5

The Cal AI pipeline description behind these two is a **reconstruction from public evidence via
a Perplexity prompt — not confirmed documentation from Cal AI.** Treat it as a source of
testable ideas, never as established fact about what Cal AI does. The ideas stand or fall on our
own measurements regardless of whether the reconstruction is accurate.

| # | date | what changed | result (range across draws) | verdict |

## Rulings

- **2026-08-07 — Tolerance bands.** Calories ±20%, each macro ±30%, all four must pass for an
  item to pass a draw. **Provisional:** pending research on restaurant-label accuracy and
  dietitian inter-rater agreement may show this is too tight or too loose.
- **2026-08-07 — Three artifacts only.** Oracle JSON + runner + this log.
- **2026-08-07 — Three starting items,** across three menus and three macro archetypes:
  `CESAR (200 g)` (andaluz), `Salmone toscano` (casa-nostra), `PASTEL AZTECA (300gr.)`
  (el-marcos). Spread deliberately rather than three from one menu — lesson 19.
- **2026-08-07 — Baseline first, no fixes before a failure list.** The pipeline is measured
  exactly as it ships before any change is designed.
